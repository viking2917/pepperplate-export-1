Pepperplate Export
====================================================

MW Changes: change pepperplate url to https, introduce a wait on page load as pepperplate seems to lock up if I hit too many pages too fast.

This super simple chrome extension does what pepperplate should - provide a way of exporting your recipes.

Installation
------------

- Download the project
- Add to chrome
- - Select "Load Unpacked" extension from the extension section. You will need to have developer mode enabled.
